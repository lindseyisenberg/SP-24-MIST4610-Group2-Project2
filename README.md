## Dataset

Water Quality Data Set: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/water-quality-data-41c5e

The data set we chose contains information about the water quality of multiple sites, denoting important information that plays a crucial role in analyzing and helping individuals use data to make determinations based on water quality data. Using key information and analytics tools many different variables that are questioned can be determined.  The data contains information about the site or location, the date it was read, and multiple different measures. These measures include PH level, salinity, water temperature, air temperature, and water depth. The data also displays the year that the data was recorded. This information allows visualizations about the water quality throughout the years to be made.
