## Dataset

Water Quality Data Set: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/water-quality-data-41c5e

The data set we chose contains information about the water quality of multiple Refuge sites ran by the United States Department of the Interior , denoting important information that plays a crucial role in analyzing and helping individuals use data to make determinations based on water quality data. Using key information and analytics tools many different variables that are questioned can be determined.  The data contains information about the site or location, the date it was read, and multiple different measures. These measures include pH level, salinity, water temperature, air temperature, and water depth. The data also displays the year that the data was recorded. This information allows visualizations about the water quality throughout the years to be made. 

## Questions
1. What is the average amount of dissolved oxygen in the water for each month from the last 20 years?


2. What factor caused dissolved oxygen to change the most over the year, and when does it occur?

## Analysis and Results

Question 1

This question shows how the amount of dissolved oxygen changes throughout the months on average. As shown, the dissolved oxygen tends to be much lower during the 
summer months, and reaches its lowest between June and September. After observing this, our second question investigates this further. 



Question 2

By looking at the heat map of all the values per month for the last 20 years, we are able 
to see that dissolved oxygen tends to be lower during the summer months. This would explain the dip in our initial graph. We know from this trend that dissolved oxygen and temperature have an inverse relationship. 
As temperature increases, dissolved oxygen in water decreases. DO levels below 5 mg/L are considered high stress for fish. Anything below 3 mg/L is considered too low to support fish, and below 1 is considered hypoxic with little to no signs of life.
The second accompanying visualization shows the change over the months of summer, and over the those months for a 20 year period (2000-2019). The trend lines clearly denoteate how this inverse relationship occurs. This visualization helps us better understand the maintenance requirements of these reserve pools by the federal government, as well as how the changing temperature and climate in our work impacts things such as wildlife reserves.
